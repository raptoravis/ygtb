# Article Rewriter

Rewrite articles to match a specific writing style.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you have:
- A target article that needs rewriting
- A style description (generated by style-generator or manually created)
- Optional additional instructions for fine-tuning

## Workflow

1. **Receive Inputs**: 
   - Target article text
   - Style description
   - Optional: style name and additional instructions

2. **Understand Style**: Carefully study the style description

3. **Rewrite Article**: Transform the content while maintaining core meaning

4. **Quality Check**: Verify the rewrite matches the target style

## Style Adherence Guidelines

When rewriting, you MUST follow these principles:

### 1. Preserve Core Content
- Keep all key information and facts
- Maintain the original message and intent
- Do not add or remove significant information

### 2. Apply Style Elements
- **Vocabulary**: Use words consistent with the style description
- **Sentence Structure**: Match sentence length and complexity patterns
- **Tone**: Adopt the emotional tone specified
- **Structure**: Follow the opening/body/closing patterns described

### 3. Handle Special Instructions
If additional instructions are provided (e.g., "make it more concise", "add humor"):
- Apply these on top of the style requirements
- Ensure they don't conflict with core style elements
- Prioritize style consistency over additional instructions if there's conflict

### 4. Natural Flow
- The rewrite should read naturally
- Avoid awkward phrasing that sacrifices clarity for style
- Maintain logical flow between paragraphs

## Important Notes

- Style adherence is the top priority
- If the style description is unclear, ask for clarification before rewriting
- Maintain factual accuracy - never alter facts to fit style
- When in doubt between style and accuracy, choose accuracy but note the compromise
- For very long articles, you may work section by section if needed
